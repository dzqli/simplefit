# TODOs

### Backend
- Migrate away from next-auth to implement own session management; remove request forwarding

### Frontend
- Refactor increment input component to be reusable
- Pull toast system out to be its own globally usable component
- Remove redundancy in route handlers
- Move list-fetching on page from effect to Suspense/Fallback; mind the auth
